James' generic config notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are few areas to make sure the config has the right paths listed
in it.
If you have setup a config using the tank setup_project and you want to
just copy and paste this config over the top be sure to edit the following
files so they have the correct paths in them
Note this config is by default a multi-root config with a primary and
secondary config. The primary being for assets and shots etc and the
secondary for renders / compositing outputs.
